## Project Overview
A retail company is holding a promotional event for a laptop on their store's website. Emails are set to be sent out containing a link for the deal. The company wants to send these emails out as efficiently as possible. Only those with a high chance of clicking the link should receive one, and all other customers should not be bothered with the spam. To figure out who should receive the email, a logistic regression model will be trained on past customer data from a similar promotion that occured years prior. The model will then be tested to see how accurately it was able to identify who would or wouldn't click on the email.

## Data Sources
All CSV files were accessed through COMP SCI 320 at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
