## Project Overview
A retail company is holding a promotional event for a laptop on their store's website. Emails are set to be sent out containing a link for the deal. The company wants to send these emails out as efficiently as possible. Only those with a high chance of clicking the link should receive one, and all other customers should not be bothered with the spam. To figure out who should receive the email, a logistic regression model was trained on past customer data from a similar promotion that occured years prior. The data was manipulated, data frames were joined, and new variables were created in order to make the model as strong as possible. Multiple performance metrics were evaluated to see how accurately the model was able to identify who would or wouldn't click on the email.

## Structure & Libraries
Contained in this repository is the Jupyter Notebook used for displaying the data collection process and regression model results, as well as a Python script containing the UserPredictor class, along with all of the necessary methods. Pandas, MatPlotLib, scikit-learn, and NumPy were all used.

## Data Sources
All CSV files were accessed through COMP SCI 320 at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
